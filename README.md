# Quiz-Application
To enhance the reliability and user-friendliness of API-integrated programs by incorporating robust error handling and UI feedback mechanisms

✅ Objective:
To implement a fully functional quiz application using Python GUI with data structures like lists and dictionaries.

🔍 Activities Performed:
Designed a multi-question quiz where each question had multiple options and a correct answer.

Used lists to store quiz questions and user responses.

Employed dictionaries to manage each question’s structure (question text, options, answer).

Managed timers, navigation (next question), and final result display.

💡 Key Concepts Learned:
Logical organization of quiz data using structured data types.

GUI event handling and state management (e.g., timers, user actions).

Tracking performance metrics like time per question and score.

⚠️ Challenges:
Coordinating between UI events and backend logic.

Tracking user answers accurately and handling skipped questions.

🧠 Reflections:
This week was the most creative and complex, showcasing how all earlier learnings could be integrated into a real-world, interactive software project. It emphasized the importance of planning and modular design.
