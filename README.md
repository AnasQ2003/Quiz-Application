To enhance the reliability and user-friendliness of API-integrated programs by incorporating robust error handling and UI feedback mechanisms
✅ Objective:
To enhance the reliability and user-friendliness of API-integrated programs by incorporating robust error handling and UI feedback mechanisms.

🔍 Activities Performed:
Implemented try-except blocks to catch exceptions such as failed requests or incorrect user input.

Provided meaningful messages in the UI when errors occurred (e.g., no internet, city not found).

Ensured the program remains functional even when some components fail.

💡 Key Concepts Learned:
Defensive programming using exception handling.

Realizing the importance of validating user inputs and network responses.

Separation of core logic and user interaction for better design.

⚠️ Challenges:
Determining where and when to catch exceptions without hiding bugs.

Providing relevant and user-friendly messages for different failure types.

🧠 Reflections:
This week deepened the understanding of writing stable software. Error handling brought a professional touch and made the applications more user-centric.
